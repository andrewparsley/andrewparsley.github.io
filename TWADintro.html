<p>heres how to play!</p>
<p>read the story, then read your two options, A and B.</p>
<p>choose which one you like best. this is the choice your character will make in the game.</p>
<p>click one of the two buttons, A or B.</p>
<p>and repeat! each time you make a choice, the story will move in a new direction.</p>
<p>when you get to the end of a path, the game will prompt you to write a new chapter describing what happens next.</p>
<p>your chapter can be anything you choose. switch genres, write short, write long, write dark, write funny. continue the story however you see fit.</p>
<p>fill in all the fields with your chapter, and press the Send Message! button.</p>
<p>once you have sent your new chapter, refresh the page. your chapter will be added to the game, where others can reply to it.</p>
<p>play the game many times, exploring different paths each time. check in on your chapters to see if others have written what comes next.</p>
<p>have fun!</p>
